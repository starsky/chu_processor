3. FFMPEG ISSUE
This program was tested on 1.2.4. It is highly probable that it won`t work on previous versions of ffmpeg.

If you have older version of ffmpeg please update it to 1.2.4 or compile it with below configuration:

./configure --enable-libx264 --enable-gpl

you can use custom ffmpeg version by pointing it by enviromental variable FFMPEG_BIN eg.:
export FFMPEG_BIN=/opt/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg
